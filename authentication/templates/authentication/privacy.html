<h2>Showcase Edu Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Last updated October 17, 2019</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or use https://showcaseedu.com (the “Site”).</p>

<h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</p>

<p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
    <li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</li>
    <li>“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>
    <li>“Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, when you create an account on the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your first name, last name (or last initial if you are under 13 years of age), age (to comply with FTC regulations protecting students under 13 years old) and email address (or a hash of your email address if you are under 13 years of age).  We refer to this information as "Account Information.” In normal usage of the Site, Account Information may also constitute any submitted links and uploaded files.</p>

<p>When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Account Information.</p>

<h3>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

<p>We use the Account Information that we collect generally to support logging into the Site, associating all Account Information with your account, and displaying a portfolio of items you have submitted to the Site.</p>

<p>Additionally, we may use this Account Information to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Communicate with you</li>
  <li>Screen usage of the Site for risk or fraud</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of any marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>

<h3>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>We use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:  https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.  You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here:  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>

<p>We may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>

<p>Personal information is not shared with any other third parties.</p>

<h3>DO NOT TRACK</h3>

<p>Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.</p>

<h3>YOUR RIGHTS</h3>
<p>If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to display your portfolio, or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above.  Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.</p>

<h3>DATA RETENTION</h3>

<p>When you create an account through the Site, we will maintain your Account Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.</p>

<h3>CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13</h3>

<p>The Site is intended for use by individuals of all ages, including children under the age of 13 with consent from their school, teacher, parent or legal guardian. Per current FTC regulations, no "Personal information" (as defined under COPPA) is collected for students under the age of 13. In particular, email addresses are stored only as one-way hashes, which can be used by the Site for login, account management and password recovery. Additionally, last names are truncated at the first letter, so teachers are still able to identify their students. If we learn that the Site has inadvertently collected Personal Information from children under the age of 13 without prior parental or teacher consent, we will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a teacher, parent or legal guardian of a Student on the Site, you can ask us to deactivate the Student’s account, delete any collected Personal Information, and request that we no longer allow the Student to submit their information to the Site. To make such a request, please contact us through the contact information below.</p>

<h3>CHANGES</h3>

<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
