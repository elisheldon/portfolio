# Showcase
A student-owned digital portfolio, available freely at https://showcaseedu.com

Showcase is a lightweight, student-driven portfolio that represents only the work students are proud to share.

Students can add files from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, upload documents and images of physical work, and link to any publicly accessible link (graphs on Desmos, projects on Code.org, video presentations on YouTube...).

Showcase is not a place for teachers to assign a grade, nor decide what is included. Students have complete control over their Showcase portfolio, and never need to justify a low grade or include a plan to improve. With this control, students can share their Showcase portfolios at family conferences, with potential employers or even when applying to colleges.

Students, teachers and other school staff members can join their school using a school code. Students' portfolios can be viewed by all school staff members, and students can additionally choose to share their portfolios publicly with a personal URL.
